Module 10 Challenge
Part I: Exploratory Climate Analysis
This part of the project analyzes Hawaii precipitation and weather station data, and produces visualizations of rainfall and temperature patterns. It also supports the planning of visits to Hawaii by providing local precipitation summaries for each weather station and daily temperature data for a flexible range of trip dates.

Components of Part I:
SQLite database: Resources/Hawaii.sqlite
Jupyter notebook: sqlalchemy-challenge/climate_analysis.ipynb (uses SQLAlchemy, Python Pandas, and Matplotlib)
Visualizations: Bar charts, histogram, and area chart (visible within the notebook and stored as .png files in the sqlalchemy-challenge folder)
Part II: Climate App
This part of the project exposes several SQLAlchemy precipitation and temperature queries through an API using a Python Flask app. The available endpoints are:

Endpoints of Part II:
Home page: /
Precipitation: /api/v1.0/precipitation (returns daily precipitation totals for the last year)
Stations: /api/v1.0/stations (returns active weather stations)
Temperature Observations: /api/v1.0/tobs (returns daily temperature observations for the WAIHEE weather station)
Trip: /api/v1.0/trip/yyyy-mm-dd (returns minimum, average, and maximum temperatures for the range beginning with the provided start date through 08/23/17)
Trip Range: /api/v1.0/trip/yyyy-mm-dd/yyyy-mm-dd (returns minimum, average, and maximum temperatures for the range beginning with the provided start and end date)
Components of Part II:
SQLite database: Resources/Hawaii.sqlite
Flask app: sqlalchemy-challenge/app.py
